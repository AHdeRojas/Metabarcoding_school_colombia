# ML-based biomonitoring tutorial

***ML tutorial for the [9th metabarcoding school](http://metabarcoding.org/spip.php?article89]), held in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, 1-6th May 2019.***

This tutorial covers the data import, manipulation, training and cross-validation of a random forest classifier, to predict the environmental impact of fish farming sites on benthic biodiversity. The data used depict eukaryotes communities obtained by metabarcoding (amplicon sequencing). The tutorial also cover feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Visual observation of macrobenthic species composition is used as a "ground truth" to determine the level of impact. The tutorial is done completely in R. The slides of the tutorial are [HERE](https://github.com/trtcrd/Metabarcoding_school_colombia/blob/master/ML_tuto_slides.pdf)

__The R script [metaB_tutorial.R](https://github.com/trtcrd/Metabarcoding_school_colombia/blob/master/metaB_tutorial.R) is commented with all the analytic steps.__
