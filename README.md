# ML-based biomonitoring tutorial

***ML tutorial for the [9th metabarcoding school](http://metabarcoding.org/spip.php?article89]), held in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, 1-6th May 2019.***

The aim of the tutorial is to analyse metabarcoding data (amplicon sequencing) to predict the environmental impact of fish farming sites on benthic biodiversity. To do that, visual observation of macrobenthic species composition is used as a "ground truth" to determine the level of impact, and metabarcoding data depicting full eukaryotes communities is used as variables (or features). This tutorial covers the data import, manipulation, training and cross-validation of a random forest classifier. It  also covers feature selection to reduce the data dimensionality and the model tuning (hyperparameter optimization). 

The tutorial is done completely in R. The introductory slides of the tutorial are [HERE](https://github.com/trtcrd/Metabarcoding_school_colombia/blob/master/ML_tuto_slides.pdf)

__The R script [metaB_tutorial.R](https://github.com/trtcrd/Metabarcoding_school_colombia/blob/master/metaB_tutorial.R) is commented with all the analytic steps.__
